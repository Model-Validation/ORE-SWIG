ORE-SWIG: Language bindings for ORE
===================================

The [Open Source Risk](http://opensourcerisk.org) project aims at
establishing a transparent peer-reviewed framework for pricing and risk
analysis. Open Source Risk Engine (ORE) is based on QuantLib
(<http://quantlib.org>) and consists of three libraries written in
C++.

Similar to QuantLib-SWIG, ORE-SWIG intends to provide the means
to use the ORE libraries side by side with QuantLib from a
number of languages including Python, Ruby, Perl, Java and C#. 

Download and usage
------------------

ORE and ORE-SWIG can be downloaded from the
[OpenSourceRisk](http://opensourcerisk.org) project site which points
to the Open Source Risk repositories on [GitHub](http://github.com/OpenSourceRisk).

The ORE-SWIG project directory contains QuantExt-SWIG, OREData-SWIG and
OREAnalytics-SWIG folders. Within the ORE-SWIG project directory, pull
in the QuantLib-SWIG project by running

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Prerequisite for building the wrappers is building ORE (upcoming
release 1.14) following the steps outlined in ORE's user guide, e.g. using CMake.

To build ORE-SWIG on Windows, macOS or Linux using CMake and
Ninja: Edit the top level CMakeLists.txt to select/deselect
specific library/language folders, create a subdirectory "build",
change to the build directory, and run

	cmake \
		-G Ninja \
		-D ORE=<ORE Root Directory> \
		[-D BOOST_ROOT=<Top level boost include directory> ] \
		[-D BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=<Location of the compiled boost libraries> ] \ 
		[-D PYTHON_LIBRARY=<Full name including path to the 'libpython*' library> ]	\
		[-D PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=<Directory that contains Python.h> ] \
		..

	ninja

Alternatively, change to a specific library/language subdirectory and follow
the instructions in its README file.

To try e.g. an OREAnalytics Python example, update your PYTHONPATH so
that it includes the directory that contains the newly built python module and
associated native library (both in
ORE-SWIG/build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python), change to
ORE-SWIG/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python/Examples and run

	python ore.py

You can also try the IPython example in the same directory: Launch

	jupyter notebook

wait for your browser to open, select ore.ipy from the list of files
and then run all cells.

To try a simple OREAnalytics Java example, change to
ORE-SWIG/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java/Examples and run 

	java -Djava.library.path=../../../build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java \
		-jar ../../../build/OREAnalytics-SWIG/Java/ORERunner.jar \
		Input/ore.xml


Python Bindings on Windows 
--------------------------

On Windows you can also use the following steps to build the Python
bindings using the provided setup.py script:

	1. Include SWIG path to the Path environment variable, e.g.
	   set Path=%Path%;C:\swigwin-3.0.12
   
	2. Add PYTHON_INCLUDE and PYTHON_LIB variables to the system environment, e.g. 
	   set PYTHON_INCLUDE="C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\include"
	   set PYTHON_LIB="C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\libs"
   
	3. Add BOOST_ROOT and BOOST_LIBRARYDIR variables to the system environment, e.g. 
	   set BOOST_ROOT=C:\repos\boost_1_65_1
	   set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\repos\boost_1_65_1\lib\x64\lib\lib
   
	4. Add ORE_DIR and QL_DIR variables to the system environment, e.g.
	   set ORE_DIR=C:\dev\ORE
   
	5. Change to directory OREAnalytics-SWIG/Python and run the following
	   python scripts to build and install ORE Analytics Python module:
	   cd Python
	   python setup.py wrap
	   python setup.py build
	   python setup.py install

	6. Try examples (all work):
	   cd Examples
	   python ore.py
	   python swap.py
	   python market.py
	   python commodityforward.py
	   python conventions.py
	   python portfolio.py

Contributing
------------

ORE-SWIG initially contains the framework for building the wrappers
including QuantLib wrappers and a limited number of wrapped classes in
each of the three ORE libraries to demonstrate the principle. Overall, ORE
contains more than 500 classes that could be added to ORE-SWIG over
time.

The easiest way to contribute additional interface files is through
pull requests on GitHub.  Get a GitHub account if you don't have it
